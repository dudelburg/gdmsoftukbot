# gdmsoftukbot - a bot for playing the game of tuk

A bot which can automatically create accounts and play rock-paper-scissors.

For it to work, adb and monkeyscript have to be available on the system.
The former can be found at https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools_r27.0.1-windows.zip (content goes
to the root directory of this script), the latter at https://dl.google.com/android/repository/sdk-tools-windows-3859397.zip
( place all files in the lib/ directory of this script, choose the right architecture and move swt.jar one level up).
